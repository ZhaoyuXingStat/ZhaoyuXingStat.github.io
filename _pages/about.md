# Dr. Hao Zeng

I am currently a Postdoctoral in Statistics at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) and National University of Singapore (NUS), Department of Statistics and Data Science, supported by the SUSTech-NUS Joint Research Program, supervised by **Prof. Bingyi Jing**, **Prof. Hongxin Wei** (SUSTech), and **Prof. Wang Zhou** (NUS). I received my PhD in Statistics from Xiamen University, where I was advised by **Prof. Wei Zhong**, with **Prof. Xingbai Xu** and **Prof. Tuo Liu** as co-advisors. I completed my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics at Shandong University. 

My research focuses on **statistical machine learning theory, methods, and their applications**, particularly developing novel methodologies that bridge statistical theory with practical applications. I am also interested in interdisciplinary research at the intersection of machine learning with econometrics and biostatistics.
