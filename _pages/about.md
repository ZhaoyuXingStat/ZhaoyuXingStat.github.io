I am currently a Robert and Sara Lumpkins Postdoctoral Research Associate at University of Notre Dame (ND) in U.S., Department of Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics. I received my PhD in Statistics from Gregory and Paula Chow Institute for Studies in Economics, Xiamen University in 2025, where I was advised by **[Prof. Wei Zhong](https://faculty.xmu.edu.cn/wzhong/zh_CN/index/559037/list/index.htm)**. During 2023-2024, I was a visiting researcher at the Australian National University (ANU), College of Business and Economics. During 2019-2021, I completed my academic master's courses in Mathmatical Statistics at Wang Yanan Institute for Studies in Economics (WISE) of Xiamen University. I completed my Bachelor of Science in Statistics ([Peng's Class: Base of Financial Mathematics&Financial Engineering](https://www.math.sdu.edu.cn/info/1026/1612.htm)) at School of Economics, Xiamen University. 

My research focuses on **statistical machine learning, methods, and their applications on networks**, particularly developing novel methodologies that bridge statistical theory with practical applications. I am also interested in interdisciplinary research at the intersection of statistics with **machine learning**, **econometrics**, and **biostatistics**.
