# Dr. Hao Zeng

I am currently a Postdoctoral in Statistics at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) and National University of Singapore (NUS), Department of Statistics and Data Science, supported by the SUSTech-NUS Joint Research Program, supervised by **[Prof. Bingyi Jing](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/jingbing-yi.html)**, **[Prof. Hongxin Wei](https://hongxin001.github.io/)** (SUSTech), and **[Prof. Wang Zhou](https://www.stat.nus.edu.sg/wang-zhou/)** (NUS). I received my PhD in Statistics from Xiamen University, where I was advised by **[Prof. Wei Zhong](https://faculty.xmu.edu.cn/wzhong/zh_CN/index/559037/list/index.htm)**, with **[Prof. Xingbai Xu](https://faculty.xmu.edu.cn/XXB/zh_CN/index.htm)** and **[Prof. Tuo Liu](https://faculty.xmu.edu.cn/LT1234/zh_CN/index/582397/list/index.htm)** as co-advisors. I completed my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics at Shandong University. 

My research focuses on **statistical machine learning theory, methods, and their applications**, particularly developing novel methodologies that bridge statistical theory with practical applications. I am also interested in interdisciplinary research at the intersection of machine learning with econometrics and biostatistics.
